Asynchronous comprehensions are only allowed inside an async def function.

In principle, asynchronous generator expressions are allowed in any context. However, in Python 3.6, due to async and await soft-keyword status, asynchronous generator expressions are only allowed in an async def function. Once async and await become reserved keywords in Python 3.7, this restriction will be removed.
